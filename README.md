This is a task app created in Laravel with CRUD functionality.

It also utilizes JQuery UI Sortable for a drag and drop feature. 

Since this is a simple static application, deployment should be straight forward with whatever hosting app you are using. Heroku should do this for you but you should only need to run npm run build.
